<p>With my practice I have had the opportunity to work with some outstanding managers and with some managers that need improvement. I have also assisted companies and divisions with strategic planning and developing managers. Given over 25 years of managerial experience at every level of management and having taught management training over an 11 year period I discussed this with my publisher. I saw a need to help those that want to be managers, new front line managers and experienced manages that want to be outstanding. As a result of that discussion I contacted the 50 best places to work in America in 2013. With feedback from 30 of these firms and my experience I wrote The Servant Manager: 203 tips from the best places to work in America (November 2013).</p>
<p>Now I am prepared to help you and your firm. The sixteen chapters in this book are an excellent source of information that offers the best practices for managers and covers their the most common concerns. I will work with you and your managers to actively engage your team in bringing home the lessons from these chapters. Active workshops and breakouts provide your managers with tools they can use today. Topical areas for workshops and breakouts may include the areas listed below or they can be tailored to your specific needs. Order my book, give me a call at 651-633-5311 or e-mail me at mg@mikegreg.com so we can work together to make your management team the best in the industry.</p>
