	<h2>About This Series</h2>
	
	<p>Michael Gregory Institute: Leadership is a series about developing leaders from the perspective of experience. With more than 28 years of managerial experience at every level of management and having taught management training over a 11 year period, Michael Gregory saw a need to help those that want to be managers, new front line managers and experienced manages that want to be outstanding. As a result, he contacted the 50 best places to work in America in 2013. With feedback from 30 of these firms and his own management/leadership experience, he wrote The Servant Manager: 203 Tips from the Best Places to Work in America (November 2013). This series is based on the book and more.</p>

	<p>The series offers the best practices for managers and covers their the most common concerns. He works with viewers to actively engage their team in bringing home the lessons offered in the series. The series provides managers with tools they can use today. Having worked with top 1000 firms such as airlines, manufacturers, service providers, accounting firms, and others, Gregory offers a training session directly related to the needs of your firm through this series.</p>
